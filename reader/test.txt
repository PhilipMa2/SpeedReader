A little chronicle of a great time may have an interest of its own
quite incommensurate from its intrinsic worth. These pages do not
pretend to any merit beyond faithfulness; but they are the true record
of the everyday life of an average family during the first year of
the war of wars; what we have felt, what we have seen; the great
anxieties; the trivial incidents and emotions which have been shared
by thousands of our fellow-countrymen. This home has been so far
exceptional that it has had few hostages to give to fortune, and that
it has mercifully been spared the supreme sacrifice demanded with such
tragic universality, and given with such a glorious resignation: but,
infinitesimal pulse, it has beaten with the great arteries, the whole
mighty heart of the British Empire.

Annals enough there are, and will be, of the soul-stirring events
of 1914: the proud rise of the nation, its struggles, its failures,
its appalling blunders, and the super-heroism that has saved the
consequences. If Armageddon be not the end of the world; if there be
generations coming after to carry the sheaves of that seed sown with
blood and tears to-day, there will be no dearth of evidence to enable
our children’s children to feed upon the story of England’s glory. They
will be able to read and learn and look back, out of the peace won for
them, to examples almost beyond the conception of idealism. Should,
by some freak of chance, this humble book survive, it may not then be
without an interest of its own.

This was how the quiet stay-at-home family felt and thought in the days
of the titanic conflict; these were the little things that happened in
a little country house. No great moral lesson certainly, no revelation
of out-of-the-way philosophy; just the way we hoped and feared; the way
we still laughed and talked, gardened and worked, the way we were led
on from day to day and made to find, after all, what seemed unbearable,
bearable, brought to see light where there was apparently no issue.

Being, as we say--so far--singularly unstricken in the midst of
so much mourning, we have been able to enjoy the lighter side of
existence, the humours, the quaintnesses, which relieve, blessedly for
poor humanity, the most complicated and the most desperate situations.
Perhaps, therefore, these random jottings, turned, many of them, to
the lighter side of life, may, in some stray hour of relaxation, amuse
here and there one actively engaged in the stern actions which the time
demands. Perhaps the breath of the garden may be grateful to a mind
upon which the wind from the trenches has blown so long.

There is a great deal of laughter about our country, even now. The
troops go singing down the roads in the early dawn, and come tramping
back to camp, with tired feet, but with joking tongues, after the long
days. We know there is much laughter in the fighting-line; innocent,
childish pleasantries, catchwords that run with grins from lip to lip.
There is no laughter so genuine as that which springs from a good
conscience. And so there is laughter in the hospitals also, thank God!

We trust our pages may add a little mirth more to the gallant spirit
abroad; beguile the fancy of one wounded man, or the oppression of one
anxious heart. Then, indeed, they will not have been written in vain.

Would only that through them we could convey an impression of the
surroundings in which we write; would we could bring our readers the
atmosphere of these Surrey heights; of the rolling moorland, of the
winds, sweet with heather, aromatic with the pine-woods, charged with
the garden scents that blow about us; then truly would they find
refreshment! Would we could show them our terraced borders where
now the roses are breaking into wonderful bloom, pink, crimson,
cream, fire-carmine, and yellow; where the delphiniums are arrayed,
noble phalanxes in every shade of enamel blue and purple--spires
marshalled together like some fantastic cathedral town, viewed in
impossible moonlight, out of a Doré dream; where the canterbury bells
are beginning to shake out their cups, tinted like the colours in a
child’s paint-box; and the campanulas, with their tones of mountain
wildness--of snow and blue distance--bring coolness into the hotter
tints of the border.

We look down on this July richness from the small white house with
its green blinds, which, though compact, round-windowed, comfortably
Georgian, has yet an absurd Italian look.

On the upper terrace wall the ornamental pots, each with its little
golden cypress, begin to foam with lobelia and creeping geranium;
between two clumps of cypress-trees, Verocchio’s little smiling boy
grips his fish against a tangle of blush rambler. And that’s a bit of
Italy for you, even with the ultimate vision of wild moor!

The terraces run down the hill, tier below tier. On the other side of
the valley the woods rise between the shouldering heather-clad hills,
to the east; the wide, long view spreads to the south-west, where the
hills begin to lift again, and distant pine-woods march across the sky.

Would we could but give to mere words the sense of altitude, of great
horizons which our high-perched position gives us!

“You’re in a kind of eyrie,” says one visitor. And another: “Oh, I do
like all this sky! It’s so seldom one really gets the sky about one.”

“You have,” said an exile--an old Belgian religious--after tottering
solemnly along the terrace walk, “you have here an earthly paradise. A
spot God has wonderfully blessed.”

Besides the startling contrasts and the fairness of its prospect, the
little place has a special charm of its own, which is not possible to
describe, yet which everyone feels who comes within its precincts.
We quite wait for the phrase now, upon the lips of guests under the
red-tiled roof: “It’s so extraordinarily peaceful.”

Peace! Peace in the midst of the boom of the war tocsin, echoing all
round! Peace, in spite of the newspapers, the letters, the rumours, the
perpetual coming and going of troops, the distant reverberations of gun
practice, the never-relaxing grip of apprehension! Yes, in spite of all
the world being at war--there is peace in the Villino.

Some of us believe it wells out from a little chamber, where, before
the golden shrine, the Donatello angels hold up never-extinguished
lamps. Or a visitor may say wonderingly: “I think it must be because
you’re all so united.” Or, perhaps, as the old monk had it, there is an
emanation from the place itself: so beautiful a spot of God’s earth, so
high up, so apart between the moor and the valley! Whatever the reason,
we wish that some of the peace that lingers here may reach out from
these pages, and touch with serenity any unquiet heart or restless
spirit that comes their way.

And since the soldiers we have written about wanted toys, like sick
children, their mascot to hug--here comes a procession of our little
fur folk walking vividly before your mental eye.

Here is Loki, the first and oldest of the pets. Loki, growing grey
about the muzzle, elderly already by reason of his six years of life;
with his immense coat, tawny, tufted, plumed, fringed; with his
consequential gait; his “quangley” ways: so easily offended, in his own
strong sense of dignity; with his over-loving heart; his half-human,
half-lion eyes; Loki, with his clockwork regularity of habit; his
disdainful oblivion, except on certain rare occasions, of the smaller
fur fry; Loki, making windmill paws to the Master of the Villino, till
he has succeeded in dragging him away from his pipe and his arm-chair
for a walk on the moors; or yet frantically and mutely imploring the
mystified visitor to go away and cease from boring him.

And here is Mimosa, the most Chinese of little ladies, hued like a ripe
chestnut, with dark orbs so immense and protuberant as almost to seem
to justify the legend that Pekinese will drop their eyes about if you
don’t take care. Very sleek and sinuous and small is she, a creature
of moods and freaks, fastidious to the point of never accepting a meal
with the other dogs; with all kinds of tricksy, pretty ways of play,
shrilly barking and dancing for bread pills, which she will fling in
the air and catch again, throw over her shoulder and waltz round to
pounce upon, more like a kitten than a little dog.

And the puppy, Loki’s own contemned daughter, the colour of a
young lion cub--the puppy, with her irrepressible enthusiasms, her
unsnubbable demonstrations, her “pretty paws,” her coal-black muzzle,
her innocent countenance--“Plain Eliza”--whose heart, like her
father’s, is so much too big and tender and faithful, that happening
the other day to see, over the garden hedge, a member of the family in
whose house she was born, she rent the air with such shrieks of ecstasy
that the whole Villino establishment rushed to the spot, thinking she
was being murdered.

Then there is Arabella, the lavrock setter. “Perverse, precise,
unseasonable Pamela,” cries Mr. B. in Richardson’s celebrated novel,
when having pursued the virtuous damsel to her last refuge, she not
unnaturally misunderstands the purport of his next advance.

When she does understand she exclaims: “Mr. B. is the noblest of men,
he has offered me marriage.”

To come back to Arabella. We wish we could find a union of epithets
as telling as that of Mr. B. in the exasperation of his conscious
rectitude. Inane, inert, inconvenient Arabella, fairly well describes
our sentiments towards her. She is a bore and a burden. She feels the
heat and goes out and takes mud-baths, and comes in and shakes herself
in the drawing-room. She cannot understand why she should not lie in
our laps as well as the puppies. She howls mournfully outside the
kitchen door unless she is invited in to assist in the cooking. She has
destroyed three arm-chair covers in the servants’ hall, preferring that
resting-place to her basket. “Fond” is the word that might best be used
to qualify our feelings towards her. We don’t know what to do with her,
but we should not like to be without her.

Then there is the black Persian, “Bunny,” our kind dead Adam’s cat. You
will meet him circling round the garden. He will raise his huge bushy
tail when he sees you, and fix his inscrutable amber eyes upon you,
questioningly. Then he will pass on with a soundless mew. He is looking
for his master, and you can watch him slink away, superb, stealthy,
pursuing his fruitless quest.

The fur children come first, being the Villino’s own family, but
there are other kinds with us now. The little Belgians run about the
paths calling to each other with their quaint pattering intonation,
so that long before you hear the words you know by the sound of
the voices coming up the hill that these are the small exiles.
Brown-haired Marthe, with her childish ways and her serious mind,
her ripe southern-tinted face, and Philippe, with his shock of fine
hair, hazel-colour, cut medieval fashion, and his little throat, which
bears his odd picturesque head as a flower-stem its bloom. And sturdy
Viviane, stumping up with her solemn air, precisely naming the flowers
as she comes:
